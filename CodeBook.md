#Code Book

###This code book will describe the data used in this project.

Overview

30 volunteers performed 6 different activities while wearing a smartphone. The smartphone captured various data about their movements. A full description is available at the site , which can be accessed here -

Explanation of each file

features.txt: Names of the 561 features.
activity_labels.txt: Names and IDs for each of the 6 activities.

X_train.txt: 7352 observations of the 561 features, for 21 of the 30 volunteers.

subject_train.txt: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in X_train.txt.
y_train.txt: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in X_train.txt.

X_test.txt: 2947 observations of the 561 features, for 9 of the 30 volunteers.

subject_test.txt: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in X_test.txt.
y_test.txt: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in X_test.txt.

More information about the files is available in README.txt. More information about the features is available in features_info.txt.
In short, for this derived dataset, these signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ

tGravityAcc-XYZ

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ

tBodyGyro-XYZ

tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ

tBodyAccMag

tGravityAccMag

tBodyAccJerkMag

tBodyGyroMag

tBodyGyroJerkMag

fBodyAcc-XYZ

fBodyAccJerk-XYZ

fBodyGyro-XYZ

fBodyAccMag

fBodyAccJerkMag

fBodyGyroMag

fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated (and kept for this assignment) from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean

tBodyAccMean

tBodyAccJerkMean

tBodyGyroMean

tBodyGyroJerkMean

Other estimates have been removed for the purpose of this excercise.

Note: features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

The resulting variable names are of the following form: tbodyaccmeanx, which means the mean value of tBodyAcc-XYZ.
